Summary:
The photo (cavity.jpg) appears to show a darkened area on a posterior tooth consistent with dental caries (a cavity) and possible surface breakdown. Depth and involvement of dentin or the pulp cannot be determined from the photo alone — radiographs and an in‑mouth exam are needed to confirm.

Risk:
Medium–High — a visibly active lesion can progress to deeper tooth structure or pulpal infection if untreated. Risk is higher if you have sensitivity, pain, swelling, or a history of rapid decay.

Actions:
- Book a dental appointment within 1–2 weeks for a clinical exam and bitewing radiographs.  
- Likely treatment: restoration (filling) if limited to enamel/dentin; root canal and crown if the pulp is involved.  
- Interim self-care: avoid chewing on that tooth, reduce sugar/snacking, brush twice daily with fluoride toothpaste and consider a fluoride rinse. Use OTC pain relievers if needed.  
- Seek urgent care sooner if you develop severe pain, swelling, fever, or drainage.
