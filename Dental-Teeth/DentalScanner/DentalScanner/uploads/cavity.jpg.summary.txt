Summary:
- Image likely shows dental caries (a cavity) — visible dark spot/hole or enamel breakdown on a tooth.
- Could involve enamel and dentin; if deep, pulp irritation or infection may already be present.
- Possible associated sensitivity, pain, or localized gum inflammation.

Risk:
- Medium — untreated cavities commonly progress to deeper decay and can lead to pulpitis or abscess.
- Risk becomes high if you have persistent pain, swelling, fever, or difficulty breathing/ swallowing (signs of spreading infection).

Actions:
- Book a dental exam with radiographs within 1–2 weeks so the dentist can assess depth and plan treatment (filling, crown, or root canal if deep).
- If you have severe pain, facial swelling, fever, or trouble breathing/ swallowing, seek urgent dental care or ER immediately.
- Short-term self-care: avoid chewing on that side, reduce sugary/acidic foods, use fluoride toothpaste, warm salt rinses, and OTC analgesics as needed.
- Bring the photo to your appointment to help document the issue.
