Summary:
The uploaded photo (cavity.jpg) appears to show one or more carious lesions — visible dark spots or small cavitation in the tooth enamel/dentin. There may also be surrounding staining and plaque buildup. If the lesion is deep it could be nearing the nerve.

Risk:
Medium–High. Untreated cavities progress from enamel into dentin and can lead to pain, infection or need for root canal/extraction. Risk is higher if you have sensitivity, visible large cavitation, swelling, or prolonged toothache.

Actions:
- Schedule a dental exam with bitewing/periapical X‑rays to determine depth and treatment (filling vs root canal).
- Maintain good oral hygiene: brush twice daily with fluoride toothpaste, floss, and reduce sugary/sticky foods.
- Avoid chewing on the affected side and use OTC analgesics (ibuprofen/acetaminophen) for pain as directed.
- Seek immediate care if you develop facial swelling, fever, severe/prolonged pain, or pus (these suggest infection).
