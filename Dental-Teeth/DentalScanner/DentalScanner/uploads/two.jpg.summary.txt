Summary:
I can’t view the photo you uploaded from here, so I’m unable to make a visual assessment. Please re-upload clear intraoral photos (frontal with teeth biting, upper and lower occlusal, and side views) and tell me any symptoms you have (pain, swelling, sensitivity, bleeding).

Risk:
Unknown without the image — cannot accurately assess. If you have pain, swelling, bleeding, fever, or loose teeth the risk is high (needs same‑day care). If you are asymptomatic and it’s a cosmetic concern the risk is low–medium until a dentist examines it.

Actions:
1) Re-upload clear photos (well‑lit, close‑up: front with bite, upper, lower, left and right) and list symptoms, age, and relevant medical history/meds.  
2) If you have severe pain, swelling, pus, fever, uncontrolled bleeding, or loose teeth — contact your dentist or an emergency clinic right away.  
3) For nonurgent issues, schedule a dental appointment and include the photos you upload here.
