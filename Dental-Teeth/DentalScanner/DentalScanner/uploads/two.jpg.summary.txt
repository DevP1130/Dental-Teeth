Summary:
I can’t open the uploaded image from here — please re-upload or describe what you see. Common findings I would look for in a photo: tooth decay (brown/black spots), gum redness/bleeding or recession, plaque/tartar buildup, chips or fractures, crowding/misalignment, or missing teeth.

Risk:
Medium — without seeing the photo I can’t be specific. Many visible issues (cavities, advanced tartar, or gum inflammation) can progress to pain, infection, or tooth loss if untreated; minor staining or early plaque is lower risk.

Actions:
1. Re-upload the photo (clear, well‑lit, mouth open, show upper and lower fronts and bite) or describe any pain, bleeding, sensitivity, or how long the issue has been present.  
2. If you have severe pain, swelling, fever, or difficulty breathing/swallowing — seek emergency dental/medical care now.  
3. Otherwise schedule an exam/cleaning with your dentist; in the meantime use gentle brushing with fluoride toothpaste, floss daily, and avoid very hard/acidic foods.
