Summary:
- Sharp pain from cold foods is most commonly dentin hypersensitivity from exposed dentin/root (recession, abrasion, erosion) but can also come from a cracked tooth, caries with exposed dentin, or developing pulpitis if the stimulus causes lingering pain.  
- A failing or leaking filling can produce the same symptom.  
- If the pain lingers after the cold or occurs spontaneously, that increases likelihood of pulp involvement.

Risk: Medium
- Medium because many cases are benign (surface sensitivity) and respond to simple measures, but persistent or lingering sharp pain often indicates deeper decay or pulpal inflammation that may require a filling or root canal.  
- Escalate to High if you have constant pain, swelling, fever, or trouble breathing/ swallowing — these are signs of infection and need urgent care.

Actions:
- Short term: avoid cold triggers, chew on the other side, use desensitizing toothpaste twice daily (potassium nitrate), rinse with fluoride mouthwash, and take OTC pain relievers (ibuprofen/acetaminophen per directions) if needed.  
- Make a dental appointment within 1–2 weeks for clinical exam and radiographs; the dentist will do percussion/bite tests and decide on restoration, repair, or endodontic treatment.  
- Seek emergency dental/medical care immediately if pain becomes constant, swelling develops, or you have fever or difficulty breathing/swallowing.
