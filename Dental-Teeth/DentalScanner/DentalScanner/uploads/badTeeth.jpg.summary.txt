Summary:
- I can’t view the uploaded photo here; based on "badTeeth.jpg" and common findings, likely issues include advanced tooth decay (cavities), broken or missing teeth, heavy staining/plaque or tartar, and possible gum disease or abscesses.

Risk:
- Medium–High. Untreated decay, fractures, or periodontal disease can lead to infection, pain, tooth loss, and systemic effects; immediate risk is higher if you have pain, swelling, pus, or fever (then it’s high).

Actions:
- If you have severe pain, facial swelling, spreading redness, pus, or fever → seek emergency dental care or ER now.
- Otherwise book a dental exam with X‑rays within 1–2 weeks for diagnosis and treatment planning (fillings, root canal, extractions, cleaning).
- Meanwhile maintain good oral hygiene, rinse with warm salt water, avoid hard/sugary foods, and use OTC pain relief as needed; send close-up photos of upper and lower teeth and any areas of pain if you can.
