Summary:
I can’t open images in this chat — please re-upload or describe what you see (discoloration, chips, swelling, visible holes, pus, loose teeth). Common possibilities based on typical "unhealthy teeth" photos: dental decay/cavities, heavy plaque/tartar and staining, gingival inflammation/recession, broken or missing restorations, or possible abscess if there is swelling.

Risk:
Medium (could be Low-to-High depending on symptoms). Untreated decay and gum disease progress and can lead to pain, infection, bone loss or tooth loss; visible swelling, pus, severe pain or fever would raise risk to High.

Actions:
1. Re-upload the photo(s) (close-up of upper and lower, biting, and side views) or describe symptoms (pain, sensitivity, bleeding, swelling, bad taste).  
2. If you have swelling, severe pain, spreading redness, or fever — seek urgent dental care or ER now.  
3. Otherwise schedule a dental exam with bitewing/periapical X‑rays; expect cleaning, fillings or further treatment as indicated.  
4. Until then: maintain soft brushing, flossing, warm salt rinses, and use OTC pain relief (ibuprofen/acetaminophen as appropriate).
